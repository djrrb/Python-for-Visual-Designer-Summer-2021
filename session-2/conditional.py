# gosh this example is stupid

# define a variable called variable, and give it a value
variable = 'hamburger'

# use an if statement to block off code that will only run if a condition is true
if variable == 'hamburger':
    # this code only runs if our variable is equivalent to the string 'hamburger'
    print('hooray')
    print('ok')
else:
    # this code only runs if the above condition is NOT true
    print('i’m hungry')
# i’ve dedented, anything from here on out will run no matter what
print('the end')
